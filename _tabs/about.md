I'm a Web3 auditor and engineer (and I guess now a writer). These days I'm mostly interested in stealing internet money.

You can expect protocol deep dives, bug breakdowns, experiments in digital minimalism, and the occasional rant on whatever's on my mind.

I write because I find teaching is one of the best ways to learn, so these articles are as much for me as they are for you.
